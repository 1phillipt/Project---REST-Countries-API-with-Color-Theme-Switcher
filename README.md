First, I created folder and files using bash command lines.
Countries.ts - contains Country interface for the blueprint contract but here is used just to fetch data from api type Country.

index.html - contain header - where in the worlds and button for changing mode for the page. It also contain search button and filer by region select options.And countries-container div where countries will be rendered.

main.ts - as of now this will import countries and country ts. and creates and adds element to the html file
